# LLM Bench

This repository is a proof-of-concept benchmark for several Language Model
Models (LLMs) using Langchain and Streamlit.

## Introduction

LLMs have gained significant attention in the field of natural language
processing (NLP) due to their ability to generate human-like text. However,
comparing the performance of different LLMs can be challenging. This repository
aims to address this challenge by providing a benchmarking framework using
Langchain and Streamlit.
